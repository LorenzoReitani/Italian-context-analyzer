#Italian context analyzer ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

In this project I will show how to use spaCy library to create an Italian context analyzer capable of recognizing the meaning of homonymous words occurring in the same sentence.

For an overview of the project, I recommend you see the ppt "project_presentation.pptx".

In "main.py" there is the first steps to analyze phrases.

In "My_NER_CPU.ipynb" "My_NER_GPU.ipynb" there are 2 guides for training personalized NER model with CPU or GPU.

In "stringhe.txt" there are the different datasets used for training. 

The directories start with "output" contain pre-trained models trained on datasets of different size.
